 TweetsOfWaste README

 This is the software to run a waste bin that is connected to the interwebs.

 Short description:
 The project consists of a waste bin, an Arduino, a WiFly shield and a C328 serial camera.
 All thrown together gives you a waste bin that tweets a picture over WiFi, everytime
 you open it.
